# ZSH-TCE

Quick and dirty packing of zsh for tiny core linux.

## Deps

I dunno lol

No seriously, I didn't think I'd distribute this so I forgot what deps
I built ZSH with in the .tcz files included.  Build and repack zsh according
to the directions below to

## Note

I did a pretty shit job of putting this together as it wasn't intended
for distribution.  However, someone wanted it so it's here.  Express your
interest in this package if you have any, and maybe I'll take the time
to package a better build and fix the deps.

## Rebuilding the TCZs

You'll probably want to do this, since I don't even remember what optional
deps I had when I built it.

Luckily this shouldn't be too tricky.

I think the only required build deps are compiletc and tcztools.

1)  Install tcztools
2)  `./zsh-get` puts the source in /tmp/zsh
3)  `./zsh-build` builds and installs to /tmp/zsh/inst with prefix /usr/local
4)  `util/dolinks` links the files from /tmp/zsh/inst into zsh and zsh-doc
5)  `tcz-package zsh zsh-doc` uses the links in ./zsh and ./zsh-doc to
    build some .tcz packages.  These will go to your tce dir by default.

tcztools should build, install and copy the resulting zsh.tcz to your tce dir.

If you make a proper build, email me a deps list and a .tcz, or even
better, take maintainer attribution and push it up to the tc team yourself.
